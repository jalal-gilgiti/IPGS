# IPGS
"Influence Preserving Graph Summarization using LSH & WLSH at Billion Scale (IPGS) is a summarization algorithm developed employing Personalized Graph Summarization and LDME algorithms. We incorporated the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) concept from LDME and applied it to Personalized Graph Summarization, enhancing the efficiency of the latter."
