# IPGS
Influence preserving Graph summerization using LSH &amp; WLSH at billion scale
IPGS is summerization algorithum developed using Personalized graph summerization and LDME algorithum, we have used Locality senstive hashing 
concept from LDME and used it in Personalized graph summerization to make the Personalized graph summerization more efficient.
